* detect when control flows into data and make that an error
* disassembler: detect the pacman-style jump table. (another example in nestest.nes)
* solve the BIT thing (search smb1 disassembly for bit instruction opcode)
* make SMB1 work
* get rid of jamfile; use .ines* declarations
* update assembler to be able to handle smb1 disassembly
* namespace everything in ppu.h
* update CLI to use commands instead of flags for commands

* use llvm memcpy intrinsic instead of libc
* optimize dynStore
* optimize dynLoad
* figure out why optimized llvm code does dead loads
